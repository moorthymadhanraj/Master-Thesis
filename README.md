# Master-Thesis
# Design and Implementation of Twitter Sentimental Analysis Application

# Abstract
In recent years, the usage of social media has increased enormously. The social media posts created by the users contain a lot of information with opinions based on businesses, products, services, and other fields. After investigating social media networks, Twitter
plays a major role with the high number of users globally and generating a huge volume of tweets every second. The transferred data would be the user’s text, which contains the emotions based on the topic posted by the users. Sentiment Analysis is a continuing
research field in text mining, and it is defined to find the emotions of the authors related to the topics. It is the method of applying natural language processing to identify the subjective information from the text. Finding these sentiments become beneficial for
several businesses, organizations, and others. There are several challenges for performing the sentiment analysis and finding the sentiment with high efficiency and scalability in terms of selecting the best approaches, tools, techniques, and libraries. This thesis mainly
focuses on achieving efficiency and scalability in this sentimental analysis by using tools and techniques like Python Libraries, Apache Spark, Natural Language Processing, and Amazon Comprehend (pre-trained, machine learning NLP model). This thesis combines
selective tools as an approach to achieve the best results on efficiency and scalability with different analyses to find several insights and predictions.

# Goal of the thesis
In this thesis, sentimental analysis is done with the datasets which are transferred on the social media network Twitter. The posts related to all topics from twitter will be taken for sentimental analysis in real-time and performs the analysis with the keyword that is
given as input. The datasets are fetched from Twitter using its Application Programming Interface (API) to take those data into the application for analysis. Pre-processing is performed for analyzing and cleaning with the natural language processing tool and amazon comprehend to perform the sentimental analysis. The sentimental analysis is
to predict the sentiments of the user’s text that is processed into this application. The results of the sentiment analysis are visualized using data visualization libraries. The major goal of this thesis is to find the sentiments from the text and classify the sentiments
with best efficiency, scalability, and accuracy by using selective tools and a pre-trained natural language processing model for the sentimental analysis and obtaining insights from the sentiments by performing different analyses with other data attributes.

# New Approach:
Combination of Apache Spark, Natural Language Processing & Amazon Comprehend

# Insights
The whole idea from the discovered insights shows that the sentiment score majorly varies depending on several factors like other data attributes retweets and favorites count. The correlation analysis gave more clarity on the relationship between the impact of sentiment
scores with respect to other data attributes on the data. The sentiment scores by hashtags give us more idea about the relevant topics discussed on this data. The trend analysis results how sentiment will be scattered on the analysis irrespective of the sentiment types
which is based on the topic of the data. The predictive analysis for the sentiment scores forecasts the impact on the sentiment scores based on specific data attributes. Overall, the opinion of the users varies based on the topic which is discussed on Twitter. This
analysis is performed using a cryptocurrency name as a keyword hence the sentiment is highly balanced. The impact on the sentiment scores depends on the topic of the data.

# Future Scope
These different types of analysis gave a greater number of insights by which we can depict the new possibilities to achieve more efficient results by adding more data attributes from the Twitter data, for example, the “description” attribute can be added which can
bring more information related to the keyword which is analyzed. Another extensive new approach can be performed by analyzing the authors based on their popularity on Twitter. The more popularity in social media networks gets a greater number of followers for the
author with more informative data. Therefore, this will give more data to perform the analysis that outcomes extensive results based on different kinds of topics.
